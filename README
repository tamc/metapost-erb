= Metapost-erb

A simple tool to turn erb templates into metapost files, run the metapost, and open the resulting files in Preview.

Also includes some support libraries to help make drawing grids and charts easier.

NB: when I say easier, I mean easier given I know ruby much better than I know metapost. There are probably elegant ways of doing this stuff in metapost itself.

Usage:
metapost-erb filenameoferb.erb
